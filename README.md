# path finnding algorithm simulation project

This is path finding program build in Tkinter GUI in python
this program uses a simple algorithm to find corect shortest path from star(blue) node to end(green) node
here I'm using tkinter button as a nodes because it is easy put stating node(blue) and end node(green) and easy to put obstacle (which is like a wall)
and easy to represent visited node(yellow) and path (light blue)
tkinter buttons are very useful when you have projects to done. 
it provides eassy way to handle the click events.
